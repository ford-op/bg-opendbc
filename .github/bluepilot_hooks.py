"""BluePilot: fail when an upstream file differs from master without being on the hook list (#47).

Compares the end state (a PR's merge result in CI), not the files a PR touched, so the nightly sync
PR and the PR resolving a sync conflict pass as long as bg-clean differs from master only by hooks.
usage: bluepilot_hooks.py <master ref> [<merge result ref>, default HEAD]"""
